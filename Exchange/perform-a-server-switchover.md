# Perform a server switchover
 **Summary**: How to move all active mailbox database copies from their current Mailbox server to one or more other Mailbox servers in an Exchange 2016 DAG. 
A server switchover is part of preparing for a scheduled outage for the current Mailbox server.
  
    
    


## What do you need to know before you begin?


- Estimated time to complete: 30 seconds per database
    
  
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Database availability groups" entry in the  [High availability and site resilience permissions](high-availability-and-site-resilience-permissions.md) topic.

## Use the EAC to perform a server switchover

You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the"Mailbox database copies" entry in the  [High availability and site resilience permissions](high-availability-and-site-resilience-permissions.md) topic.
  
    
    

1. In the EAC, go to **Servers** > **servers**.
    
  
2. Select the Mailbox server you want to switchover.
    
  
3. In the details pane, select **Server Switchover**.
    
  
4. On the **Server Switchover** page, do one of the following:
    
1. Accept the default setting of **Automatically choose a target server** (in which case, the system automatically selects the best Mailbox server for each database being switched over), and then click **save**.
    
  
2. Click **Use the specified server as the target for switchover**, click **Browse** to select a Mailbox server, and then click **save**.
    
  
5. When the switchover has completed, click **close** to exit the **Server Switchover** page.
    
  

## Use the Shell to perform a server switchover

This example performs a server switchover for the server MBX1. The system automatically selects the best Mailbox server for each active database on MBX1.
  
    
    

```

Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase -Server MBX1
```

This example performs a server switchover of the Mailbox server MBX4. When the command completes, MBX5 hosts the active copy of the databases that were previously active on MBX4.
  
    
    



```
Move-ActiveMailboxDatabase -Server MBX4 -ActivateOnServer MBX5
```
