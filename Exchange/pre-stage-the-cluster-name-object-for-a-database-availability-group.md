# Pre-stage the cluster name object for a database availability group
 **Summary**: Pre-stage and provision a cluster name object (CNO) for an Exchange 2016 database availability group (DAG).
In environments where computer account creation is restricted, or where computer accounts are created in a container other than the default computers container, you can pre-stage the cluster name object (CNO) and then provision the CNO by assigning permissions to it.
  
    
    

Pre-staging the CNO is also required for Windows Server 2012 and Windows Server 2012 R2 DAG members due to permissions changes in Windows for computer objects. When deploying a database availability group (DAG) using Mailbox servers that are running Windows Server 2012 or Windows Server 2012 R2, you must pre-stage and provision the CNO, unless you are deploying a DAG without a cluster administrative access point. DAGs without cluster administrative access points do not use CNOs; therefore pre-staging is not required for those DAGs.
You create and disable a computer account for the CNO, and then either:
  
    
    


- Assign full control of the computer account to the computer account of the first Mailbox server you're adding to the DAG.
    
    **-Or-**
    
  
- Assign full control of the computer account to the Exchange Trusted Subsystem universal security group (USG).
    
  

## What do you need to know before you begin?


- Estimated time to complete: 1 minute
    
  
- You must use an account that has permissions to create computer objects in Active Directory.
    
  
- After completing the following steps, allow time for Active Directory replication to occur. After the object is replicated, you can add the first member to the DAG.

## What do you want to do?


  
    
    

### Pre-stage the CNO


1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
    
  
2. Expand the forest node.
    
  
3. Right-click the organizational unit (OU) in which you want to create the new account, select **New**, and then select **Computer**.
    
  
4. In **New Object - Computer**, type the computer account name for the CNO in the **Computer name** box. This is the name that you'll use for the DAG. Click **OK** to create the account.
    
  
5. Right-click the new computer account, and then click **Disable Account**. Click **Yes** to confirm the disable action, and then click **OK**.
    
  

### Assign permissions to the CNO


1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
    
  
2. If Advanced Features aren't enabled, turn them on by clicking **View**, and then clicking **Advanced Features**.
    
  
3. Right-click the new computer account, and then click **Properties**.
    
  
4. In **<Computer Name> Properties**, on the **Security** tab, click **Add** to add either the computer account for the first node to be added to the DAG or to add the Exchange Trusted Subsystem USG:
    
  - To add the Exchange Trusted Subsystem, type Exchange Trusted Subsystem in the **Enter the object names to select** field. Click **OK** to add the USG. Select the Exchange Trusted Subsystem USG and in the **Permissions for Exchange Trusted Subsystem** field, select **Full Control** in the **Allow** column. Click **OK** to save the permission settings.
    
  
  - To add the computer account for the first node to be added to the DAG, click **Object Types**. In the **Object Types** dialog box, clear the **Built-in security principals**, **Groups**, and **Users** check boxes. Select the **Computers** check box and click **OK**. In the **Enter the object names to select** field, type the name of the first Mailbox server to be added to the DAG, and then click **OK**. Select the first node's computer account, and in the **Permissions for <NodeName>** field, select **Full Control** in the **Allow** column. Click **OK** to save the permission settings.
    
  

## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully created the CNO, do the following:
  
    
    

1. Open Active Directory Users and Computers.
    
  
2. Expand the forest node.
    
  
3. Open the OU in which you created the account, and then verify that the account is listed.
