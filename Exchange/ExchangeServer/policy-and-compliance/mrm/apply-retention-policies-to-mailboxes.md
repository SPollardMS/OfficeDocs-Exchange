# Apply a retention policy to mailboxes in Exchange 2016

 **Summary**: Learn how to use the Exchange Management Shell or the Exchange admin center apply a retention policy to mailboxes in Exchange 2016.
  
You can use retention policies to group one or more retention tags and apply them to mailboxes to enforce message retention settings. A mailbox can't have more than one retention policy.
  
> [!CAUTION]
> Messages are expired based on settings defined in the retention tags linked to the policy. These settings include actions such moving messages to the archive or permanently deleting them. Before applying a retention policy to one or more mailboxes, we recommended that you test the policy and inspect each retention tag associated with it. 
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

To see what permissions you need, see the "Applying retention policies" entry in the [Messaging policy and compliance permissions in Exchange 2016](../../permissions/feature-permissions/policy-and-compliance-permissions.md) topic.

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to apply a retention policy to a single mailbox

This example applies the retention policy RP-Finance to Morris's mailbox.
  
```
Set-Mailbox "Morris" -RetentionPolicy "RP-Finance"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Set-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/a0d413b9-d949-4df6-ba96-ac0906dedae2.aspx).
  
## Use the Exchange Management Shell to apply a retention policy to multiple mailboxes

This example applies the new retention policy New-Retention-Policy to all mailboxes that have the old policy Old-Retention-Policy.
  
```
$OldPolicy={Get-RetentionPolicy "Old-Retention-Policy"}.distinguishedName
Get-Mailbox -Filter {RetentionPolicy -eq $OldPolicy} -Resultsize Unlimited | Set-Mailbox -RetentionPolicy "New-Retention-Policy"
```

This example applies the retention policy RetentionPolicy-Corp to all mailboxes in the Exchange organization.
  
```
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Set-Mailbox -RetentionPolicy "RetentionPolicy-Corp"
```

This example applies the retention policy RetentionPolicy-Finance to all mailboxes in the Finance organizational unit.
  
```
Get-Mailbox -OrganizationalUnit "Finance" -ResultSize Unlimited | Set-Mailbox -RetentionPolicy "RetentionPolicy-Finance"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/8a5a6eb9-4a75-47f9-ae3b-a3ba251cf9a8.aspx) and [Set-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/a0d413b9-d949-4df6-ba96-ac0906dedae2.aspx).
  
## How do you know this worked?

To verify that you have applied the retention policy, run the [Get-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/8a5a6eb9-4a75-47f9-ae3b-a3ba251cf9a8.aspx) cmdlet to retrieve the retention policy for the mailbox or mailboxes. 
  
This example retrieves the retention policy for Morris's mailbox.
  
```
Get-Mailbox Morris | Select RetentionPolicy
```

This command retrieves all mailboxes that have the retention policy RP-Finance applied.
  
```
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited | Where-Object {$_.RetentionPolicy -eq "RP-Finance"} | Format-Table Name,RetentionPolicy -Auto
```
