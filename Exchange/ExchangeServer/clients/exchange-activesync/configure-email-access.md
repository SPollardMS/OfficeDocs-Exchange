This article is about enabling users in your organization to access their Exchange 2016 mailboxes with their mobile devices using Exchange ActiveSync.

## Configure a mobile phone or device to use Exchange ActiveSync

Most mobile phones and devices are capable of using Autodiscover in Exchange to configure the mobile email client to use Exchange ActiveSync. To configure an email account on most mobile devices, you'll need two pieces of information.
  
- The user's email address
    
- The user's password
    
If the mobile phone is unable to contact the Exchange server automatically through the Autodiscover service, you'll need to set up the mobile phone manually. Manual setup requires the user's email address and password, as well as the Exchange ActiveSync server name. In most organizations, the Exchange ActiveSync server name is the same as the Outlook on the web server name without the /owa, for example, mail.contoso.com.
