# Mail-enable or mail-disable a public folder

 **Summary**: Learn how to mail-enable or mail-disable a public folder with the Exchange admin center (EAC) or with the Exchange Management Shell.
  
Public folders are designed for shared access and provide an easy and effective way to collect, organize, and share information with other people in your workgroup or organization. Mail-enabling a public folder allows users to post to the public folder by sending an email message to it. When a public folder is mail-enabled additional settings become available for the public folder in the Exchange admin center (EAC), such as email addresses and mail quotas. In the Exchange Management Shell, before a public folder is mail-enabled, you use the **Set-PublicFolder** cmdlet to manage all of its settings. After the public folder is mail-enabled, you use the **Set-PublicFolder** and the **Set-MailPublicFolder** cmdlets to manage the settings. 
  
If you want users on the Internet to send mail to a mail-enabled public folder, you need to set addition permissions using the **Add-PublicFolderClientPermission** cmdlet. 
  
For additional management tasks related to managing public folders, see [Public folder procedures](public-folder-procedures.md).
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes
    
- To ensure that users on the Internet can send e-mail messages to a mail-enabled public folder, the public folder needs to have at least the  _CreateItems_ access right granted to the Anonymous account. If you want to learn how to do this, see [Allow anonymous users to send email to a mail-enabled public folder](#CreateItems.md) later in this article. 
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Public folders" entry in the [Sharing and collaboration permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/sharing-and-collaboration.md) topic. 
    
- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/keyboard-shortcuts-in-eac.md).

Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=60612), [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=267542), or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=285351). 
  
## Use the EAC to mail-enable or mail-disable a public folder

1. Navigate to **Public folders** > **Public folders**.
    
2. In the list view, select the public folder that you want to mail-enable or mail-disable.
    
3. In the details pane, under **Mail settings**, click **Enable** or **Disable**.
    
4. A warning box displays asking if you are sure you want to enable or disable email for the public folder. Click **Yes** to continue. 
    
If you want external users to send mail to this public folder, make sure you follow the steps in [Allow anonymous users to send email to a mail-enabled public folder](#CreateItems.md).
  
## Use the Exchange Management Shell to mail-enable a public folder

This example mail-enables the public folder Help Desk.
  
```
Enable-MailPublicFolder -Identity "\Help Desk"
```

This example mail-enables the public folder Reports under the Marketing public folder, but hides the folder from address lists.
  
```
Enable-MailPublicFolder -Identity "\Marketing\Reports" -HiddenFromAddressListsEnabled $True
```

If you want external users to send mail to this public folder, make sure you follow the steps in [Allow anonymous users to send email to a mail-enabled public folder](#CreateItems.md).
  
For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Enable-MailPublicFolder](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/6fc7ba9a-62a8-4f41-811f-608363aa1397.aspx).
  
## Use the Exchange Management Shell to mail-disable a public folder

This example mail-disables the public folder Marketing\Reports.
  
```
Disable-MailPublicFolder -Identity "\Marketing\Reports"
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Disable-MailPublicFolder](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/92d6c890-a96a-469a-b864-99d9656b12e0.aspx).
  
## Allow anonymous users to send email to a mail-enabled public folder
<a name="CreateItems"> </a>

You can use either Outlook or the Exchange Management Shell to set permissions on a public folder's Anonymous account. You can't use the EAC to set permissions on the Anonymous account.
  
 **Use Outlook to set permissions for the Anonymous account**
  
1. Open Outlook using an account that's been granted Owner permissions on the email-enabled public folder you want anonymous users to send mail to.
    
2. Navigate to **Public folders - \<user's name\>**.
    
3. Navigate to the public folder you want to change.
    
4. Right-click on the public folder, click **Properties** and then select the **Permissions** tab. 
    
5. Select the **Anonymous** account, select **Create items** under **Write**, and then click **OK**.
    
 **Use the Exchange Management Shell to set permissions for the Anonymous account**
  
This example sets the  `CreateItems` permission for the Anonymous account on the "Customer Feedback" mail-enabled public folder. 
  
```
Add-PublicFolderClientPermission "\Customer Feedback" -AccessRights CreateItems -User Anonymous

```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Add-PublicFolderClientPermission](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/d68ad7a9-daa0-4e6d-b819-5cca891c8fd9.aspx).
