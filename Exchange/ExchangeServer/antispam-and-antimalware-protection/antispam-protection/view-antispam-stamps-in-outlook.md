# View antispam stamps in Outlook

Learn how to use Outlook to view the antispam stamps that Exchange 2016 applied to an email message.
  
The built-in antispam agents in Exchange Server 2016 apply diagnostic metadata, or stamps, as X-headers to messages as they enter your organization. For more information about these stamps, see [Antispam stamps](antispam-stamps.md). You can use Microsoft Outlook to view the antispam X-header fields in messages to help you diagnose spam-related problems.
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete this procedure: less than 5 minutes
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox access" entry in the [Mail flow permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/mail-flow-permissions.md) topic. 
    
- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/keyboard-shortcuts-in-eac.md).

Visit the forums at: [Exchange Server](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=60612), [Exchange Online](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=267542), or [Exchange Online Protection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=285351). 
  
## Use Outlook 2010, Outlook 2013, or Outlook 2016 to view antispam stamps

1. Open Outlook on a client computer, and in the **Mail** view, double-click a message to open it. 
    
2. In the **Tags** section of the Ribbon, click the **Message Options** icon to display the message **Properties** dialog box. 
    
3. In the **Properties** dialog box, in the **Internet headers** section, use the scroll bar to view the antispam X-headers. The header fields to look for are: 
    
  - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SenderIdResult:**
    
  - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SCL:**
    
  - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-PCL:**
    
  - **X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Antispam-Report:**
    
    It can be easier for you to find these values by selecting all of the text in the **Internet headers** field (CTRL key + A), copying the text (CTRL key + C, or right-click and choose **Copy**), and pasting the text into Notepad.
    
    Here's an example of the values that you might find in a suspicious messages:
    
  ```
  X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SenderIdResult:Fail
  X-MS-Exchange-Organization-SCL:6
  X-MS-Exchange-Organization-PCL:7X-MS-Exchange-Organization-Antispam-Report: DV:3.3.15608.880;SID:SenderIDStatus Fail;PCL:PhishingLevel SUSPICIOUS;CW:CustomList;PP:Presolved;TIME:TimeBasedFeatures;OrigIP:10.1.1.1
