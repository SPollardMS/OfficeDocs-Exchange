# Manage health sets and server health

 **Summary**: Exchange Management Shell cmdlets that can help you monitor the health of your Exchange organization.
  
You can use the built-in health reporting cmdlets to perform a variety of tasks related to managed availability, such as:
  
- Viewing the health of a server or group of servers
    
- Viewing a list of health sets
    
- Viewing a list of probes, monitors, and responders associated with a particular health set
    
- View a list of monitors and their current health
    
For more information about health reporting and managed availability, see [Managed availability](managed-availability.md).
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete each procedure: 2 minutes

## Use the Exchange Management Shell to view server health

You can use the Exchange Management Shell to get a summary of the health of an Exchange server.
  
Run either of the following commands to view the health sets and health information on an Exchange server:
  
```
Get-HealthReport -Identity <ServerName>
```

```
Get-ServerHealth -Identity <ServerName> | Format-Table Server,CurrentHealthSetState,Name,HealthSetName,AlertValue,HealthGroupName -Auto
```

Run any of the following commands to view the health sets on an Exchange server or database availability group:
  
```
Get-ExchangeServer | Get-HealthReport -RollupGroup
```

```
Get-ExchangeServer | Get-HealthReport -RollupGroup -HealthSetName <HealthSet>
```

```
(Get-DatabaseAvailabiltyGroup <DAGName>).Servers | Get-HealthReport -RollupGroup
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-HealthReport](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/f33fbed5-0e01-4d7e-a252-121b2afb6864.aspx).
  
## Use the Exchange Management Shell to view a list of health sets

A  *health set*  is a group of monitors, probes and responders for a component that determine whether the component is healthy or unhealthy. 
  
Run the following command to view the health sets on an Exchange server:
  
```
Get-HealthReport -Server <ServerName>
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-HealthReport](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/f33fbed5-0e01-4d7e-a252-121b2afb6864.aspx).
  
## Use the Exchange Management Shell to view the probes, monitors and responders for a health set

You can use the Exchange Management Shell to view the list of probes, monitors, and responders associated with a health set on an Exchange server.
  
Run the following command to view the probes, monitors and responders associated with a health set on an Exchange server:
  
```
Get-MonitoringItemIdentity -Server <ServerName> -Identity <HealthSetName> | Format-Table Identity,ItemType,Name -Auto
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-MonitoringItemIdentity](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/7a4da080-0fe6-4dd7-85a2-cceeb68f95e0.aspx).
  
## Use the Exchange Management Shell to View a List of Monitors and Their Current Health

The health of a monitor is reported by using the "worst of" monitors in the health set. You can view the details of a health set to see which monitors are healthy and which ones are unhealthy.
  
Run the following command to view a list of the monitors and their current health on an Exchange server:
  
```
Get-ServerHealth -HealthSet <HealthSetName> -Server <ServerName> | Format-Table Name, AlertValue -Auto
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [Get-ServerHealth](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/ca9cff3a-ecda-422d-abd7-b7d8da71a6c7.aspx).
