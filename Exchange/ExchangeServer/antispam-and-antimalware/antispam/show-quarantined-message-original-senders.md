# Configure Outlook to show the original sender in the spam quarantine mailbox

 **Summary**: Learn how to create a custom Outlook form that allows you to view the original sender, recipient, and SCL value for messages in the spam quarantine mailbox in Exchange 2016.
  
Spam quarantine is a feature of the Content Filter agent that reduces the risk of losing legitimate messages. Spam quarantine provides a temporary storage location for messages that are identified as spam and that shouldn't be delivered to a user mailbox inside the organization. For more information, see [Spam quarantine in Exchange 2016](spam-quarantine.md).
  
When a message meets the spam quarantine threshold, it's wrapped in a non-delivery report (also known as an NDR, delivery status notification, DSN, or bounce message) and delivered to the spam quarantine mailbox. Because the quarantined messages are stored as NDRs, the postmaster address of your organization will be listed as the **From:** address for all messages. However, having the original sender address, the original recipient address, and the original spam confidence level (SCL) in the field list would make it easier to locate the message you want to recover. 
  
By default, you can't add these fields in the message view in Microsoft Outlook. You need to create an Outlook form that adds the original sender, original recipient, and original SCL as optional fields that you can select. After you create this custom form, you can configure Outlook to display these fields in the message view.
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete this procedure: 15 minutes.
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Mailbox access" entry in the [Mail flow permissions](../../permissions/feature-permissions/mail-flow-permissions.md) topic. 
    
- This procedure requires that you've configured the quarantine mailbox. For more information, see [Configure a spam quarantine mailbox](configure-quarantine-mailboxes.md).
    
- You need to configure an Outlook profile that you use to access the spam quarantine mailbox. For more information about configuring and using multiple Outlook profiles, see [Overview of Outlook e-mail profiles](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=178975).
    
    You can use MAPI utilities (for example, OutlookSpy or MFCMAPI) to find the MAPI properties in a quarantined message that contain the original sender, recipient, and SCL values. If you find that other MAPI properties give better results than the ones identified in this topic, you can use them in the custom Outlook form.
    
- For information about keyboard shortcuts that may apply to the procedures in this topic, see [Keyboard shortcuts in the Exchange admin center](../../about-documentation/eac-keyboard-shortcuts.md).

## Step 1: Use Notepad to create a custom Outlook form

1. Open Notepad, and copy the following code into the document.
    
  ```
  [Description]
  MessageClass=IPM.Note
  CLSID={00020D31-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
  DisplayName=Quarantine Extension Form
  Category=Standard
  Subcategory=Form
  Comment=This form allows the Original Sender (ReceivedRepresentingEmailAddress), Original Recipient (To), and Original SCL (OriginalScl) values to be viewed as columns.
  LargeIcon=IPML.ico
  SmallIcon=IPMS.ico
  Version=3.0
  Locale=enu
  Hidden=1
  Owner=Microsoft Corporation
  Contact=Your Name
  [Platforms]
  Platform1=Win16
  Platform2=NTx86
  Platform9=Win95
  [Platform.Win16]
  CPU=ix86
  OSVersion=Win3.1
  [Platform.NTx86]
  CPU=ix86
  OSVersion=WinNT3.5
  [Platform.Win95]
  CPU=ix86
  OSVersion=Win95
  [Properties]
  Property01=ReceivedRepresentingEmailAddress
  Property02=DisplayTo
  Property03=OriginalScl
  [Property.ReceivedRepresentingEmailAddress]
  Type=31
  NmidInteger=0x0078
  DisplayName=ReceivedRepresentingEmailAddress
  [Property.DisplayTo]
  Type=31
  NmidInteger=0x0E04
  DisplayName=DisplayTo
  [Property.OriginalScl]
  Type=3
  NmidPropset={41F28F13-83F4-4114-A584-EEDB5A6B0BFF}
  NmidString=OriginalScl
  DisplayName=OriginalScl
  [Verbs]
  Verb1=1
  [Verb.1]
  DisplayName=&amp;Open
  Code=0
  Flags=0
  Attribs=2
  [Extensions]
  Extensions1=1
  [Extension.1]
  Type=31
  NmidPropset={00020D0C-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}
  NmidInteger=1
  Value=1000000000000000
  ```

2. Save the file in your Office Forms folder using the following values:
    
  - **Path**:  `<OfficeInstallPath>\<OfficeVersion>\Forms\<LCID>`
    
  - ** _\<OfficeInstallPath\>_**: 
    
  - For 32-bit versions of Office on 32-bit versions of Microsoft Windows, or 64-bit versions of Office on 64-bit versions of Windows, the default path is  `C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office`.
    
  - For 32-bit versions of Office on 64-bit versions of Windows, the default path is  `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office`.
    
  - ** _\<OfficeVersion\>_**
    
  - **Outlook 2010**:  `Office14`
    
  - **Outlook 2013**:  `Office15`
    
  - **Outlook 2016**:  `Office16`
    
  - ** _\<LCID\>_**: This is your locale ID (LCID) value. For example, the LCID for US English is 1033. For more information, see [KB221435: List of supported locale identifiers in Word](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=787605).
    
  - **Name**: For the rest of this procedure, assume the file is named  `QTNE.cfg`. The name of the file isn't important, but be sure to enclose the value in quotation marks so the file is saved as QTNE.cfg and not QTNE.cfg.txt.
    
    For example, for a 32-bit US English version of Outlook 2016 installed on a 64-bit version of Windows, save the file as:
    
  ```
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Office\Office16\Forms\1033\QTNE.cfg"
  ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > If Windows User Access Control (UAC) prevents you from saving the file in the correct location, save it first to a temporary location, and then copy it. 
  
## Step 2: Configure Outlook 2010, Outlook 2013, or Outlook 2016 to use the custom Outlook form

1. Open the spam quarantine mailbox in Outlook on a client computer, and click **File** \> **Options** \> **Advanced**.
    
2. In the **Developers** section, click **Custom Forms**.
    
3. In the **Options** dialog box that opens, click **Manage Forms**.
    
4. In the **Forms Manager** dialog box that opens, click **Install**. Browse to the location of the  `QTNE.cfg` file, select it, and click **Open**. In the **Form Properties** dialog box, review the information, and then click **OK** to install the Quarantine Extension Form in your Personal Forms library. 
    
5. Back in the **Forms Manager** dialog box, click **Close**. Click **OK** twice to close the remaining dialog boxes and return to the main Outlook interface. 
    
6. In the **Mail** view of the Inbox, click **View** \> **Add columns**.
    
7. In the **Show Columns** dialog box that opens, in the **Select available columns from** drop-down list, scroll to the end of the list and select **Forms**.
    
8. In the **Select Enterprise forms for this folder** dialog box that opens, in the **Selected Forms** field, select **Message** and click **Remove**. In the **Personal Forms** field, select **Quarantine Extension Form**, and then click **Add**. When you are finished, click **Close**.
    
9. Back in the **Show Columns** dialog box, in the **Available Columns** section, select one or more of the following fields and click **Add** after each field you select. 
    
  - **ReceivedRepresentingEmailAddress**: Original sender
    
  - **DisplayTo**: Original recipient (note that this appears as **To** after you add it) 
    
  - **OriginalScl**: Original SCL
    
    Use the **Move Up** or **Move Down** buttons to position the columns in the view. For best results, position the new fields after the **Attachment** field, and before the **From** field. When you are finished, click **OK** twice to return to the main Outlook interface. 
    
## How do you know this worked?

You know this procedure worked if you can see the original sender, original recipient, or original SCL values for quarantined messages in the spam quarantine mailbox using Outlook.
