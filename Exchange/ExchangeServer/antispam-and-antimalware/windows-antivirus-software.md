# Running Windows antivirus software on Exchange 2016 servers

 **Summary**: Learn about setting up Windows antivirus programs to run successfully on Exchange 2016 servers by configuring exclusions.

When you run Windows antivirus programs on Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 servers, you can help enhance the security and health of your Exchange organization. However, if they aren't configured correctly, Windows antivirus programs can cause problems in Exchange 2016.

There are two basic components of any Windows antivirus program:

- *Memory-resident scanning* or *real-time protection* monitors all files and processes that are loaded and running in a computer's active memory. 

- *File-level scanning* refers to checking files on the hard disk for viruses manually or on a regular schedule. Some antivirus programs start an on-demand scan automatically after the virus signatures are updated to make sure that all files are scanned with the latest signatures. 

The biggest potential problem is a Windows antivirus program might lock or quarantine an open log file or database file that Exchange needs to modify. This can cause severe failures in Exchange 2016, and it might also generate 1018 event log errors. Therefore, excluding these files from being scanned by the Windows antivirus program is very important.

Another issues to consider is that Windows antivirus programs can't replace email-based antispam and antimalware solutions because Windows antivirus programs that run on Windows servers can't detect viruses, malware, and spam that are distributed only through email.

## Recommended exclusions for Windows antivirus programs on Exchange 2016 servers

When you deploy a Windows antivirus program on an Exchange 2016 server, make sure that the folder exclusions, process exclusions, and file name extension exclusions that are described in these sections are configured for both memory-resident and file-level scanning.

 **Note**: The **%ExchangeInstallPath%** value is typically `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\Exchange Server\V15\` (includes a trailing "\"), the **%SystemRoot%** value is typically `C:\Windows` (doesn't include a trailing "\"), and the **%SystemDrive%** value is typically `C:` (doesn't include a trailing "\"). 

The locations of many of these Exchange folders are configurable in the Exchange Management Shell. To learn how to open the Exchange Management Shell in your on-premises Exchange organization, see **Open the Exchange Management Shell**.

### Folder exclusions
<a name="Folder"> </a>

Exclude the following folders from file-level scanning and memory-resident scanning on Exchange 2016 servers.
