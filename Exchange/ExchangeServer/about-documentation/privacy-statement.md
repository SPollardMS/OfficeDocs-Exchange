# Exchange Server 2016 Privacy Statement

Microsoft is committed to protecting your privacy, while delivering software that brings you the performance, power, and convenience you desire in your personal computing. This privacy statement applies to Microsoft Exchange Server 2016. It focuses on features that communicate with the Internet. It does not apply to any other online or offline Microsoft sites, products, or services.
  
Exchange Server 2016 delivers email, calendaring, contact management, unified communication and other online collaboration functionalities on your PC's, mobile phones, and web browsers.
  
This privacy statement addresses the deployment and use of Exchange Server 2016 in an enterprise network environment. If you use Exchange Server technologies as a service operated by Microsoft or a third party, please refer to the service-specific privacy and security policies provided by Microsoft or the third party service provider.
  
IT administrators of the Microsoft Exchange Server 2016 may choose to enable or disable certain Internet-enabled features in Exchange, or to deploy other privacy impacting technologies, based on legal or compliance considerations or internal policies. You should direct privacy-related requests related to the entity providing you access to Exchange Server 2016 to that entity. Microsoft is not responsible for the privacy practices of its customers or other third parties.
  
## Collection and Use of Your Information

The information we collect from you will be used by Microsoft and its controlled subsidiaries and affiliates to enable the features you are using and to provide the service(s) or carry out the transaction(s) you have requested or authorized. It may also be used to analyze and improve Microsoft products and services.
  
We may send standard service communications such as welcome letters, billing reminders, information on technical service issues, and security announcements. Some Microsoft services may send periodic member letters that are considered part of the service. We may occasionally request your feedback, invite you to participate in surveys, or send you promotional mailings to inform you of other products or services available from Microsoft and its affiliates.
  
In order to offer you a more consistent and personalized experience in your interactions with Microsoft, information collected through one Microsoft service may be combined with information collected through other Microsoft services. We may also supplement the information we collect with information obtained from other companies. For example, we may use services from other companies that enable us to derive a general geographic area based on your IP address in order to customize certain services to your geographic area.
  
 **Except as described in this statement, personal information you provide will not be transferred to third parties without your consent.**
  
We occasionally hire other companies to provide limited services on our behalf, such as answering customer questions about products or services or performing statistical analysis of our services. We will provide those companies only the personal information they need to deliver the service, and they are prohibited from using that information for any other purpose.
  
Microsoft may access or disclose information about you, including the content of your communications, in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; (b) protect the rights or property of Microsoft or our customers, including the enforcement of our agreements or policies governing your use of the services; or (c) act on a good faith belief that such access or disclosure is necessary to protect the personal safety of Microsoft employees, customers, or the public.
  
Information that is collected by or sent to Microsoft by Exchange Server 2016 may be stored and processed in the United States or in any other country/region in which Microsoft or its affiliates, subsidiaries, or service providers maintain facilities. Microsoft abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the United States Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of data from the European Union, the European Economic Area, and Switzerland.
  
 **Collection and Use of Information about Your Computer**
  
When you use software with Internet-enabled features, information about your computer ("standard computer information") is sent to the web sites you visit and online services you use. Microsoft uses standard computer information to provide you Internet-enabled services, to help improve our products and services, and for statistical analysis. Standard computer information typically includes information such as your IP address, operating system version, browser version, and regional and language settings. In some cases, standard computer information may also include hardware ID, which indicates the device manufacturer, device name, and version. If a particular feature or service sends information to Microsoft, standard computer information will be sent as well.
  
The privacy details for other Exchange Server 2016 feature, software, or service listed in this privacy statement describe what additional information is collected and how it is used.
  
 **Security of Your Information**
  
Microsoft is committed to helping protect the security of your information. We use a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example, information you provide is stored on computer systems with limited access, which are located in controlled facilities.
