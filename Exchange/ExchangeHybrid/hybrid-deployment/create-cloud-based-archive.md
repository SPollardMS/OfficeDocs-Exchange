# Create a cloud-based archive for an on-premises primary mailbox in an Exchange hybrid deployment

In an Exchange hybrid deployment, you can configure an on-premises primary mailbox with a cloud-based archive mailbox in Exchange Online.
  
[Step 1: Enable a cloud-based archive mailbox for a primary on-premises mailbox](create-cloud-based-archive.md#step1)
  
[Step 2: Verify that the cloud-based archive mailbox is created](create-cloud-based-archive.md#step2)
  
[(Optional) Run directory synchronization](create-cloud-based-archive.md#forcedirsync)
  
## Before you begin

- The user with the on-premises primary mailbox must a user account in your Office 365 organization.
    
- The Office 365 user account must be assigned an Exchange Online Archiving for Exchange Server license. The steps for assigning a license are included in the procedures in Step 1.
    
- After you enable the cloud-based archive mailbox in Step 1, it might take up to 30 minutes for the cloud-based archive mailbox to be provisioned. This is because the cloud-base archive mailbox is created by the process of directory synchronization, where your on-premises Active Directory is synchronized with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) in Office 365. By default, directory synchronization runs once every 30 minutes. 
    
## Step 1: Enable a cloud-based archive mailbox for a primary on-premises mailbox
<a name="step1"> </a>

Use one of the following procedures to enable a cloud-based archive mailbox for an on-premises primary mailbox. Perform these steps in the Exchange admin center in your on-premises Exchange organization and in the Office 365 admin center. 
  
[Create a cloud-based archive mailbox for a new user](create-cloud-based-archive.md#newuser)
  
[Create a cloud-based archive mailbox for an existing user](create-cloud-based-archive.md#existinguser)
  
### Create a cloud-based archive mailbox for a new user
<a name="newuser"> </a>

1. In the EAC in your on-premises organization, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
2. Click **New**![Add Icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.gif) \> **User mailbox**.
    
3. On the **New user mailbox** page, create a mailbox for a new or existing user. For more information about creating a user mailbox, see [Create User Mailboxes](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/51a8b4c6-a53e-41c5-8bb1-ea4c0eaa0174.aspx).
    
4. Click **More options** to enable a cloud-based archive mailbox. 
    
5. Under **Archive**, click the **Create an in-place archive for this user** check box, and then click **Cloud-based archive**. The name of the domain that the archive mailbox will be provisioned in is displayed. 
    
    ![Under Archive, click the checkbox and then click Cloud-based archive](../media/43d0473e-30ad-4021-94bc-a9c5449f43ba.png)
  
6. Click **Save** to create the mailbox and the cloud-based archive. 
    
    Note on the **Mailboxes** page, the value **User (Archive)** is displayed in the **Mailbox type** column for the selected mailbox. 
    
7. Wait up to 30 minutes for directory synchronization to create a corresponding user account in Office 365.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > In the Office 365 admin center, go to **Health** \> **Directory sync status** to see the last time that directory synchronization occurred. 
  
8. After verifying that directory synchronization has occurred after you created the new on-premises mailbox, in the Office 365 admin center, go to **Users** \> **Active users**, and then select the new Office 365 user account that was created for the new on-premises mailbox.
    
9. On the user properties page that's displayed, click **Edit** in the ** Product licenses ** section. 
    
    ![Click Edit in the details pane to assign a license to the selected user](../media/383a9068-53cb-420a-a05e-823e8b5a2c25.png)
  
10. Under the **Location** drop-down menu, select a location for the user. 
    
11. Expand the list of Office 365 Enterprise licenses, and then assign the **Exchange Online Archiving for Exchange Server** license, and then save the changes. 
    
    In the **Status** column in the list of users, notice that a license is now assigned to the user. 
    
12. Once again, wait up to 30 minutes for directory synchronization to provision a cloud-based archive mailbox. Go to Step 2 to see how to verify that the cloud-based archive mailbox has been created. After the archive mailbox is created, the user can access it by using Outlook or Outlook on the web.

### Create a cloud-based archive mailbox for an existing user
<a name="existinguser"> </a>

1. In the Office 365 admin center, go to **Users** \> **Active users**, and then select the user account that you want to create a cloud-base archive mailbox for.
    
2. On the user properties page that's displayed, click **Edit** in the ** Product licenses ** section. 
    
    ![Click Edit in the details pane to assign a license to the selected user](../media/383a9068-53cb-420a-a05e-823e8b5a2c25.png)
  
3. Under the **Location** drop-down menu, select a location for the user. 
    
4. Expand the list of Office 365 Enterprise licenses, and then assign the **Exchange Online Archiving for Exchange Server** license, and then save the changes. 
    
    In the **Status** column in the list of users, notice that a license is now assigned to the user. 
    
5. In the EAC in your on-premises organization, go to **Recipients** \> **Mailboxes**.
    
6. In the list of mailboxes, select the user that you just assigned the assigned the license to. 
    
7. In the details pane, under **In-Place Archive**, click **Enable**. 
    
    ![Click Enable in the details pane to enable the archive mailbox for the selected user](../media/17ce99f7-d154-4e21-bec1-c938af1d4a0a.png)
  
8. On the **Create in-place archive** page, click **Cloud-based archive**, and then click **Ok**. The name of the domain that the archive mailbox will be provisioned in is displayed. 
    
    ![On the Create in-place archive page, click Cloud-based archive](../media/9ad047c9-ef47-47df-93cc-0fab872f1ae1.png)
  
    Note on the **Mailboxes** page, the value **User (Archive)** is displayed in the **Mailbox type** column for the selected mailbox. 
    
9. Wait up to 30 minutes for directory synchronization to create the cloud-based archive mailbox. Go to Step 2 to see how to verify that the cloud-based archive mailbox has been created. After the archive mailbox is created, the user can access it by using Outlook or Outlook on the web.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > In the Office 365 admin center, go to **Health** \> **Directory sync status** to see the last time that directory synchronization occurred.

## Step 2: Verify that the cloud-based archive mailbox is created
<a name="step2"> </a>

As previously explained, there might be a delay between the time that you enable a cloud-based archive mailbox and when it's actually created. This is because directory synchronization has to run to create the cloud-based archive mailbox. Here are some ways to verify that the cloud-based archive mailbox has been created.
  
In your Exchange Online organization, run the following PowerShell command to display properties related to a user's archive mailbox. To connect to Exchange Online using remote PowerShell, see [Connect to Exchange Online PowerShell](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?/linkid=396554).
  
```
Get-MailUser <cloud mail user> | FL *archive*
```

The following screen shots show the properties that are returned when the provisioning of the cloud-based archive mailbox is pending and after the archive mailbox has been created.
  
 **Mail user properties before the cloud-based archive mailbox is provisioned by directory synchronization**
  
![Cloud-based mail user properties before the cloud-based archive is provisioned](../media/c6a42713-f061-4761-93c1-2b5478953e46.png)
  
Before directory synchronization provisions the cloud-based archive, the  _ArchiveStatus_ property is set to  `None`. Also note that the  _ArchiveGuid_ and  _ArchiveName_ properties are empty. 
  
 **Mail user properties after the cloud-based archive mailbox is provisioned by directory synchronization**
  
![Cloud-based mail user properties after the cloud-based archive is provisioned](../media/005fcc87-6253-4218-aafc-50f212de54fa.png)
  
After directory synchronization provisions the cloud-based archive, the  _ArchiveStatus_ property is set to  `Active`, and the  _ArchiveGuid_ and  _ArchiveName_ properties are populated. At this point, the user will be able to access their cloud-based archive mailbox in Outlook or Outlook on the web. 
  
![User can access their cloud-based archive mailbox in Outlook or Outlook on the web](../media/8777bc4d-05c3-4489-8d8c-ff5429a0b2c3.png)
  
You can also run the following PowerShell command in your on-premises Exchange organization to display properties related to a user's cloud-based archive mailbox.
  
```
Get-Mailbox <on-premises user mailbox> | FL *archive*
```

 **On-premises mailbox properties before the cloud-based archive mailbox is provisioned by directory synchronization**
  
![Mailbox properties before the cloud-based archive is provisioned](../media/d5625bc8-03de-439a-8a0a-051ff537a0bf.png)
  
Before directory synchronization provisions the cloud-based archive, the  _ArchiveStatus_ property is set to  `None` and the  _ArchiveState_ property is set to  `HostedPending`.
  
 **On-premises mailbox properties after the cloud-based archive mailbox is provisioned by directory synchronization**
  
![Mailbox properties after the cloud-based archive is provisioned](../media/9b42d562-1b0a-4722-97aa-35d0ef6f9372.png)
  
After directory synchronization provisions the cloud-based archive, the  _ArchiveStatus_ property is set to  `Active` and the  _ArchiveState_ property is set to  `HostedProvisioned`. At this point, the user will be able to access their cloud-based archive mailbox in Outlook or Outlook on the web.

## (Optional) Run directory synchronization
<a name="forcedirsync"> </a>

As previously explained, the cloud-base archive mailbox is created by the process of directory synchronization. By default, your on-premises Active Directory is synchronized with Azure AD in Office 365 once every 30 minutes. You can see when the last time directory synchronization occurred by going to **Health** \> **Directory sync status** in the Office 365 admin center. 
  
In some cases, you might want to start directory synchronization to provision the cloud-based archive mailbox before the next scheduled synchronization. You can do this by running the following PowerShell command on the server where Azure AD Connect is installed. 
  
```
Start-ADSyncSyncCycle -PolicyType Delta
```

For more information, see [Azure AD Connect sync: Scheduler](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=836813).
