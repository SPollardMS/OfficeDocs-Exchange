# Navigating menus with Outlook Voice Access

Outlook Voice Access is a feature in Unified Messaging (UM) that enables users to retrieve email and voice mail messages and manage their calendar and personal contacts by using an analog, digital, or mobile telephone. They can interact with their mailbox using their telephone keypad or voice commands, but must use the keypad on their telephone to search for a user in the directory for your organization. 
  
When UM-enabled users call in to an Outlook Voice Access number, they can sign in to their mailbox using a telephone and are presented with a series of voice prompts. These voice prompts help them navigate the voice mail system menus and enable them to access their mailbox. Outlook Voice Access lets users do the following:
  
- Retrieve, listen to, reply to, create, and forward voice or email messages.
    
- Listen to or change calendar information.
    
- Change personal options, such as a PIN, or call or send a voice message to a personal contact.
    
An Outlook Voice Access number is assigned to a user when they're enabled for UM. The user can find an Outlook Voice Access number to access their mailbox in the welcome message that's sent to them when they're enabled for UM or by signing in to their mailbox using Outlook Web App, going to **Options** \> **Telephone**, and locating the Outlook Voice Access number or numbers in the **Outlook Voice Access** section. 
  
After a user enters their extension number and PIN, the voice mail system will let them know how many new voice mail and email messages they have and when their next meeting is. After the voice mail system has played this prompt, an Outlook Voice Access main menu will be read to the user and the user can say one of the following:
  
- Voice mail
    
- Email
    
- Calendar 
    
- Personal options
    
## Reading and reviewing email
<a name="readreviewemail"> </a>

Users can listen to, reply to, create, and forward unread email messages using the telephone. For example, if a user is expecting an important email message, and does not have access to the Internet, they can use a mobile telephone to dial an Outlook Voice Access number.

## Managing calendar meetings and appointments
<a name="managecalendaritems"> </a>

Users can listen to, reply to, create, and forward meeting requests and appointments in their calendar over the telephone. 
  
For example, a user has a meeting at 10:00 A.M. However, because of some unexpected delays, the user will be 15 minutes late. The user can inform the other meeting attendees by calling the telephone number for Outlook Voice Access, signing in to their mailbox, and then accessing the list of meetings for that day in the calendar. After the voice mail system reads the meeting request for the 10:00 A.M. meeting, the user can use the I'll be late feature to inform all the meeting attendees that the user will be 15 minutes late. Each attendee will receive an email message that informs them that the user will be 15 minutes late. The user also has the option to attach a voice mail message. 
  
In another example, a user may have an important client who decides to schedule an all-day meeting on very short notice. The user must cancel all other meetings for that day in the simplest possible way. Using the Clear my calendar feature, users can quickly and easily clear their calendar for the whole day.
