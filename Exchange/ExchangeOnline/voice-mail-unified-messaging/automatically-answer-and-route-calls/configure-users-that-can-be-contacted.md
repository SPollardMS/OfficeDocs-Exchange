## What do you want to do?

### Use the EAC to configure the group of users that callers can contact

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to change, and then click **Edit**![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Auto Attendants**, select the UM auto attendant you want to configure, and then click **Edit**![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the **UM Auto Attendant** page \> **Address book and operator access**, under **Options for searching the address book**, choose from the following options:
    
  - **In this dial plan only** Select this option to allow callers who connect to the UM auto attendant to locate and contact users who are in the dial plan associated with the UM auto attendant. 
    
  - **In the entire organization** Select this option to allow callers who connect to the UM auto attendant to locate and contact anyone listed in the organization's address book. This includes all users who are mailbox-enabled. 
    
4. Click **Save**.
    
### Use the Shell to configure the group of users that callers can contact

This example sets the scope of the users that callers can contact to all users in the organization's address book on a UM auto attendant named  `MyUMAutoAttendant`.
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -ContactScope GlobalAddressList
```
