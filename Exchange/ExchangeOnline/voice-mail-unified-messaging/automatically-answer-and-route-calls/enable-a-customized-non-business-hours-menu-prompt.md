# Enable a customized non-business hours menu prompt

You can customize the menu prompt to be used by a Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant outside business hours. After you create a UM auto attendant, a default system prompt ("Welcome to Unified Messaging") is used as the menu prompt that callers hear after the non-business hours welcome greeting is played. Although the system prompt mustn't be replaced or changed, you can customize the greetings and menu prompts that are used with UM auto attendants. After you create a customized non-business hours menu prompt audio file, you must enable menu navigation entries on the UM auto attendant for non-business hours. 
  
If you only want to include the name of your organization or business as part of the default system prompt, you can enter the name in the **Business name** box on the UM auto attendant. For details, see [Enter a business name](enter-a-business-name.md).
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You must configure business hours on the auto attendant. When you configure business hours, the non-business hours are set automatically. For details, see [Configure business hours](configure-business-hours.md). 
  
For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures.md).

### Use the Shell to enable a customized non-business hours menu prompt

This example enables a UM auto attendant named  `MyUMAutoAttendant` that has business hours configured to be 10:45 to 13:15 (Sunday), 09:00 to 17:00 (Monday), and 09:00 to 16:30 (Saturday) and holiday times and their associated greetings configured to be "  `New Year`" on January 1, 2013, and " `Building Closed for Construction`" from April 24, 2013 through April 28, 2013.
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -BusinessHoursSchedule 0.10:45-0.13:15,1.09:00-1.17:00,6.09:00-6.16:30 -HolidaySchedule "New Year,newyrgrt.wav,1/2/2013","Building Closed for Construction,construction.wav,4/24/2013,4/28/2013"
```

This example configures a UM auto attendant named  `MyAutoAttendant` and enables non-business hours navigation menus so that when callers press 1, they're forwarded to another UM auto attendant named  `SalesAutoAttendant`. When they press 2, they're forwarded to extension number 12345 for  `Support`, and when they press 3, they're sent to another UM auto attendant that plays an audio file. 
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyAutoAttendant - 
AfterHoursKeyMappingEnabled $true -
AfterHoursKeyMapping "1,Sales,,SalesAutoAttendant","2,Support,12345","3,Directions,,,directions.wav"
```
