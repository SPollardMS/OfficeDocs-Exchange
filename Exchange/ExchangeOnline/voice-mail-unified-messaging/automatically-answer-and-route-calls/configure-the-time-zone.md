# Configure the time zone

By default, the Unified Messaging (UM) auto attendant uses the time zone of the Mailbox server on which it's created. However, there are situations where you may have to change the time zone for a UM auto attendant to a different time zone. For example, if you have two UM dial plans and each dial plan represents a different time zone, you must configure one UM auto attendant to have the same time zone as the Mailbox server and the other UM auto attendant to have a time zone that differs from the Mailbox server.
  
For additional management tasks related to UM auto attendants, see [UM auto attendant procedures](um-auto-attendant-procedures.md).
