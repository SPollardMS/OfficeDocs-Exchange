# Configure an auto attendant for users who have similar names

You can configure the method to use for users with similar names on an auto attendant's **Address book and operator access** options, or you can leave the default setting on the auto attendant and configure this setting on the dial plan associated with the auto attendant. By default, an auto attendant can disambiguate between two or more users who have the same or similar names because the default setting on the auto attendant is **Inherit from dial plan**.

### Use the Shell to configure a UM auto attendant for users with similar names

This example sets the information to be included with users with similar names to Prompt for Alias for a UM auto attendant named  `MyUMAutoAttendant`.
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -MatchedNameSelectionMethod PromptForAlias
```

This example sets the information to be included with users with similar names to the title of the users, enables name lookups, and enables callers that dial into the auto attendant to press \* to be presented with the Outlook Voice Access welcome greeting for a UM auto attendant named  `MyUMAutoAttendant`.
  
```
Set-UMAutoAttendant -Identity MyUMAutoAttendant -MatchedNameSelectionMethod Title -NameLookupEnabled $true -StarOutToDialPlanEnabled $true
```
