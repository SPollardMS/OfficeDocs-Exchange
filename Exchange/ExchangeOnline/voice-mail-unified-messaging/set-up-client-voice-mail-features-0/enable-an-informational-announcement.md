# Enable an informational announcement for Outlook Voice Access users

You can enable an informational announcement on a Unified Messaging (UM) dial plan. Informational announcements are used for general announcements that change more frequently than the welcome greeting does, or for announcements that are required by corporate compliance policies. 
  
By default, callers, including Outlook Voice Access users who dial in to an Outlook Voice Access number that's been configured, don't hear an informational announcement. If you want one to be played, you must create a .wav or .wma file to use for the informational announcement after you create a UM dial plan, and then enable the informational announcement on the dial plan.
  
When it's important that the whole informational announcement is heard, you can configure the announcement to be uninterruptible. This prevents a caller from pressing a key or speaking a command to interrupt and stop the announcement.
  
For more information about the menu options that are available for Outlook Voice Access users, see the Quick Reference Guide for Outlook Voice Access, which is available from the [Microsoft Download Center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkId=272767).
  
For additional management tasks related to UM dial plans, see [Dial Plan Procedures](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/1bda77c8-c4e2-4ae0-a001-76ae029bf843.aspx).
