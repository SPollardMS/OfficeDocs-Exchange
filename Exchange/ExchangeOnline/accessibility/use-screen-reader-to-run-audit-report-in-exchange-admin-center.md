## Get started
<a name="BKMK_GetStarted"> </a>

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 subscription and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started.
  
### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

## Find data to troubleshoot configuration and security issues
<a name="BKMK_Troubleshoot"> </a>

Troubleshoot configuration issues by examining logged information about mailbox access by non-owners, Exchange Online configuration changes, and administrator role group updates. This information is available on the **Compliance Management** tab and the **Auditing** page of the EAC. 
  
### Search for non-owner mailbox access

When Exchange mailbox auditing is enabled for a mailbox, information is recorded in the mailbox audit log whenever a user other than the owner accesses that mailbox. Each log entry includes information about who accessed the mailbox and what actions were performed. Search for non-owner mailbox access when you need to troubleshoot possible security issues.
  
> [!NOTE]
> Before you can search for non-owner mailbox access, you or another Admin must enable mailbox audit logging, which is done in the Remote Windows PowerShell. [Learn more about running a non-owner mailbox access report](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=799418).
