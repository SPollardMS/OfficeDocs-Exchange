6. When you finish adding users, tab to the **OK** button and press Enter. The **Export** **Mailbox Audit Logs** dialog box has the focus again, and the **Send the audit report to** text box lists the audit log recipients. 
    
12. Tab to the ** export ** button and press Enter. Exchange retrieves entries in the mailbox audit log that meet your search criteria, saves them to a file named SearchResult.xml, and then attaches the XML file to an email message sent within 24 hours to your selected audit log recipients. 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > If you hear an error message that says the items you're trying to open couldn't be found, check that audit logging is enabled for the selected mailboxes. Also check that the selected dates are within range. The dates need to be after the date audit logging was enabled, and, by default, within the past 90 days. 
  
## Review a mailbox audit log
<a name="BKMK_review"> </a>

1. Open Outlook and sign in to your mailbox (or the mailbox where the audit log was sent).
    
2. In the Inbox, find and open the message sent by Exchange or Outlook with a subject including "Mailbox Audit Log Search" and an XML file attachment named SearchResult.xml. The body of the email message contains the search criteria for this exported audit log.
    
    > [!TIP]
    > If Outlook is not configured to allow XML attachments, you might receive the email message but not be able to open the XML attachment. Also, if you can't find the message, you might need to wait longer. Recipients typically receive the exported audit log within 24 hours, but in some cases it might take a few days. 
  
3. Select the message attachment and specify that you want to download the XML file.
    
4. Open the SearchResult.xml file in Excel. Each log entry includes information about non-owners of the mailbox who accessed the mailbox and the actions performed. The following fields are included, among others, in the audit log:
    
|**This mailbox audit log field**|**Gives this information**|
|:-----|:-----|
|Owner  <br/> |The owner of the mailbox accessed by a non-owner  <br/> |
|LastAccessed  <br/> |The date and time of the most recent mailbox access  <br/> |
|Operation  <br/> |The action performed by the non-owner  <br/> |
|OperationResult  <br/> |Whether the action performed by the non-owner succeeded or failed  <br/> |
|LogonType  <br/> |The type of non-owner access, like administrator, delegate, or external Microsoft datacenter administrator  <br/> |
|ClientIPAddress  <br/> |The IP address of the computer used by the non-owner to access the mailbox  <br/> |
|LogonUserDN  <br/> |The display name of the non-owner  <br/> |
|Subject  <br/> |The subject line of the message affected by the non-owner  <br/> |
