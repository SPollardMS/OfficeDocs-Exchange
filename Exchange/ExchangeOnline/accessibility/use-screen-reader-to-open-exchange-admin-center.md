# Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center

Exchange Online is a web-based service that you access through the Exchange admin center (EAC), which operates within your web browser. Using a screen reader and keyboard shortcuts, you can open the EAC and perform administrative tasks for the admin role group to which you've been assigned.
  
> [!NOTE]
> When you work in the EAC, we recommend that you use Internet Explorer as your web browser. For more information about the keyboard shortcuts you can use to navigate the EAC and about other accessibility features that are available for Exchange Online, refer to [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787614.aspx) and [Learn more about accessibility features in Exchange Online](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/XXX.aspx). 
  
1. Sign in to your organization's Office 365 account. In the **App launcher**, move the focus to the **Admin** app. You hear "Go to the Office 365 admin center, Link." Press Enter. 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > If you use the **My apps** page to open your apps, to quickly move to the **Admin** app (sometimes one of the last apps on the list), move the focus to the **Search apps** box (one of the first elements on the page). In JAWS, you hear "Leaving menus, My apps, Edit, Type text." In Narrator, you hear "Search apps, Editing." Type admin, and then move the focus to the only search result on the page: **Admin** app. You hear "Admin link." Press Enter. 
  
2. As the **Office 365 admin center** opens, in JAWS, you hear "Office 365, Office admin center, Home." In Narrator, you hear "Office 365, Editing." 
    
3. To move the focus to the **Expand** link in the navigation pane, press the Tab key until you hear one of the following two options: 
    
  - "Expand navigation menu button." To expand the navigation pane, press Spacebar.
    
  - "Collapse navigation menu button." The navigation pane is already expanded, so no action is required.
    
4. To move the focus to **Admin centers** (the last item in the navigation pane), press the Tab key until you hear "Admin centers." 
    
5. To ensure that the **Admin centers** list is expanded so that you can access the items in it, press the Tab key. Then, based on the audible feedback you hear, perform one of the following two actions: 
    
  - If you hear "Exchange link, Open Exchange admin center in a new tab," the list is already expanded and you've selected **Exchange**. 
    
  - If you hear something other than "Exchange link, Open Exchange admin center in a new tab," the list is collapsed. To move the focus back to the **Admin centers** list, press Shift+Tab. To expand the list, press Enter. In the expanded **Admin centers** list, to select **Exchange**, press the Tab key until you hear "Exchange link, Open Exchange admin center in a new tab." 
    
6. To open the **Exchange admin center**, press Enter. As the **Exchange admin center** opens in a new tab in your web browser, in JAWS, you hear "Exchange admin center." In Narrator, you hear "Microsoft Exchange." 
    
7. To move the focus to **Dashboard** (the first link), in the navigation pane of the **Exchange admin center**, press Ctrl+F6 twice. In Narrator, you hear "Dashboard, Primary navigation link." 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > To move to the rest of the items in the navigation pane, press the Tab key. To open an item, press Enter. After you've opened an item, to move directly to one of its elements in the content area on a page, press Ctrl+F6. To identify the admin role groups to which you've been assigned, which determine the tasks you can perform in the EAC, refer to [Use a screen reader to identify your admin role in Exchange Online](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/xxxx.aspx).
