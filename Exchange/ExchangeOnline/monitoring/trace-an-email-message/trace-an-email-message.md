# Trace an email message

As an administrator, you can use the message trace feature to follow messages as they pass through your Exchange Online or Exchange Online Protection service. With message tracing, you can determine whether a targeted email message was received, rejected, deferred, or delivered by the service. It also shows what events have occurred to the message before reaching its final status. Getting detailed information about a specific message lets you efficiently answer your user's questions, troubleshoot mail flow issues, validate policy changes, and alleviates the need to contact technical support for assistance.
