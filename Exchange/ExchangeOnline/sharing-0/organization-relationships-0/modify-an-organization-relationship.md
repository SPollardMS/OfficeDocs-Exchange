# Modify an organization relationship in Exchange Online

An organization relationship lets users in your Office 365 organization share calendar free/busy information with other Office 365 or on-premises Exchange organizations. You may want to change the settings of an organization relationship, such as changing the name, temporarily disabling calendar sharing, changing the access level, or changing which security groups will share calendars. 
  
To learn more about organization relationships, see [Organization relationships in Exchange Online](organization-relationships-0.md).
  
## What do you need to know before you begin?

- Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes.
    
- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the [Permissions in Exchange Online](../../permissions/permissions.md) topic. 
    
- If you want to share calendars with an on-premises Exchange organization, the on-premises Exchange administrator has to set up an authentication relationship with the cloud (also known as "federation") and must meet minimum software requirements.
    
- The procedures in this topic make changes to an organization relationship named Contoso. The examples show how to:
    
  - Add a domain named service.contoso.com to the organization relationship.
    
  - Disable free/busy sharing for the organization relationship.
    
  - Change the free/busy access level from  _Calendar free/busy information with time, subject, and location_ to  _Calendar free/busy information with time only_.
