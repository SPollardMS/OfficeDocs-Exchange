# Outlook on the web in Exchange Online

By default, Outlook on the web, formerly known as Outlook Web App, is enabled in Office 365. Outlook on the web lets users access their Office 365 mailbox from almost any Web browser.
  
 For information about the Client Access server role in Office 365, see [Clients and mobile in Exchange Online](../../clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online/clients-and-mobile-in-exchange-online.md).
  
## Overview of Outlook on the web

Fully supported web browsers give users access to features such as conversation view, Inbox rules, the reading pane, and the Scheduling Assistant. Browsers that aren't fully supported can still be used, but users will see the light version of Outlook Web App, which has fewer features.
  
## Managing Outlook on the web

In Office 365, the most common Outlook on the web management tasks can be accomplished in the Exchange Administration Center (EAC). All these tasks, and many others, can be accomplished by using the Exchange Management Shell.
