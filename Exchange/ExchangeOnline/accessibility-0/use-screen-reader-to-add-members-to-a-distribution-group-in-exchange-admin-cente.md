Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 subscription and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started.
  
### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).
  
For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787614).
  
Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows so, in your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows for Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=317550).
  
### Confirm your Office 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in Office 365 business and enterprise subscription plans. But capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.

) and [Exchange Online Service Description.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=797553
).
