# Get started using a screen reader in the Exchange admin center

You can use a screen reader with the Exchange admin center (EAC) in Exchange Online to carry out administrative tasks. The EAC works with Narrator, the built-in screen reader in Windows, or JAWS, a third-party screen reader. These screen readers convert text to speech to read the contents of the EAC window.

## Get started
<a name="GKMK_GetStarted"> </a>

Navigate with Internet Explorer and keyboard shortcuts, and make sure that you have the appropriate Office 365 subscription and admin role to work in the EAC. Then, open the EAC and get started.
  
### Use your browser and keyboard to navigate in the EAC

Exchange Online, which includes the EAC, is a web-based application, so the keyboard shortcuts and navigation may be different from those in Exchange 2016. [Accessibility in the Exchange admin center](accessibility-in-exchange-admin-center.md).
  
For best results when working in the EAC in Exchange Online, use Internet Explorer as your browser. [Learn more about Internet Explorer keyboard shortcuts](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=787614).
  
Many tasks in the EAC require the use of pop-up windows so, in your browser, be sure to [enable pop-up windows for Office 365](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=317550).
  
### Confirm your Office 365 subscription plan

Exchange Online is included in Office 365 business and enterprise subscription plans, but capabilities may differ by plan. If your EAC doesn't include a function described in this article, your plan might not include it.
  
For more information about the Exchange Online capabilities in your subscription plan, go to [What Office 36 business product or license do I have?](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=797552) and [Exchange Online Service Description](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=797553).
  
### Open the EAC, and confirm your admin role

[Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md)[Use a screen reader to open the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-open-exchange-admin-center.md) and check that your Office 365 global administrator has assigned you to any admin role group, for example, Organization Management. You know you are assigned to at least one admin role group if you can open the EAC. Learn how to [Use a screen reader to identify your admin role in the Exchange admin center](use-screen-reader-to-identify-admin-role-in-exchange-admin-center.md).
  
## Work with screen readers
<a name="BKMK_WWScrnRdr"> </a>

The EAC works with the Narrator and JAWS screen readers, among others. These screen readers convert text to speech and read you commands, locations, alt text on images, and the contents of EAC screens and pop-up windows.
  
- To turn Narrator on or off on a PC, in Windows, press Windows logo key+Enter. 
    
- To turn Narrator on or off on a tablet, press Windows logo button+Volume Up. 
    
- If Narrator doesn't read a newly opened window, press F5. Refreshing the browser window resets the focus and Narrator reads the window.
    
- If your screen reader stops reading, press Alt+Tab to leave the current window, and then press Alt+Tab again to return to it. This resets the focus on the current window to get your screen reader to read the window properly. 
    
For more information about Narrator, refer to [Hear text read aloud with Narrator](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=798799). For more information about JAWS, refer to the [JAWS Screen Reader documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=787625).
