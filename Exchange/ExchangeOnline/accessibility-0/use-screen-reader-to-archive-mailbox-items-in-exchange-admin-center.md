## Apply a retention policy to a user
<a name="BKMK_ApplyRetention"> </a>

The messaging records management (MRM) feature in Exchange Online helps you manage the life cycle of your organization's email; it allows you to set retention policies. Retention policies specify when certain types of mailbox items—including regular email messages, deleted items, and junk mail—should be moved, archived, or deleted. Exchange Online automatically applies the Default MRM Policy when you create a new mailbox with an archive or when you enable an archive for an existing mailbox user.
  
 **Note** You can customize the Default MRM Policy by adding or removing retention tags or by modifying tag settings. You can also replace the default policy with any retention policies you create. To view, edit, or create a retention policy, on the EAC primary navigation pane, select the compliance management link and then, on the menu bar, select the retention policies link. [Learn more about retention policies](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=799151).
  
You can apply the same retention policy to all users, or you can apply different policies to certain users.
  
1. In the EAC, press Ctrl+F6 until the primary navigation pane has the focus and you hear "Dashboard, Primary navigation link."
    
2. Tab to **recipients** and press Enter. 
    
3. To move to the menu bar, press Ctrl+F6. You hear "Mailboxes, Secondary navigation link." To select the **mailboxes** link, press Enter. 
    
4. To search for the user for whom you want to enable archiving, press Ctrl+F6 and then press the Tab key until you hear "Search button." Press Enter.
    
5. Type all or part of the user's name and press Enter. 
    
6. Press Ctrl+F6 until you hear the name of the user in the search results list. If the search results list includes multiple names, press the Down Arrow key or the Up Arrow key until you hear the name you want. Press Enter.
    
7. In the **Edit User Mailbox** dialog box which opens, with the focus on the tab names, press the Down Arrow key until the focus is on the **mailbox features** tab. 
    
8. Tab to the **Retention policy** combo box. **Default MRM Policy** is the default entry. Press the Down Arrow key or the Up Arrow key to move through the available policies. Select the policy you want for this user.
