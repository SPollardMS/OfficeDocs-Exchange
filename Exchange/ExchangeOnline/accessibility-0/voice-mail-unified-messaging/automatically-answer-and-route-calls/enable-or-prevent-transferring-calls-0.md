## What do you want to do?

### Use the EAC to enable or prevent call transfers to users from a UM auto attendant

1. In the EAC, navigate to **Unified Messaging** \> **UM dial plans**. In the list view, select the UM dial plan you want to change, and then click **Edit**![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
2. On the **UM Dial Plan** page, under **UM Auto Attendants**, select the UM auto attendant for which you want to configure call transfer, and then click **Edit**![Edit icon](../../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).
    
3. On the **UM Auto Attendant** page \> **Address book and operator access**, under **Options for contacting users**, select the check box next to **Allow callers to dial users** to enable calls to be transferred. To prevent call transfers, clear the check box. 
    
4. Click **Save**.
