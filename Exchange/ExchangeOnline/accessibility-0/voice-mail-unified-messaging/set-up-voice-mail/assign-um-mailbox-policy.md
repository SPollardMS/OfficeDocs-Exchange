# Assign a UM mailbox policy

When you enable a user for Unified Messaging (UM) and voice mail, you must select the UM mailbox policy that will be associated with the user's mailbox. You can change the UM mailbox policy associated with the user's mailbox after the user has been enabled for UM.
  
You create UM mailbox policies to apply a common set of policies or security settings to a collection of mailboxes of UM-enabled users. You can use UM mailbox policies to apply settings such as the following:
  
- PIN policies
    
- Dialing restrictions
    
- Other general UM mailbox policy properties
    
> [!NOTE]
> A default UM mailbox policy is created every time you create a UM dial plan. You can delete the default UM mailbox policies or create additional UM mailbox policies based on the needs of your organization. 
  
For additional management tasks related to users who are enabled for voice mail, see [Voice mail-enabled user procedures](voice-mail-enabled-user-procedures.md).
