1. After you are on the EAC Dashboard (home) page, to navigate to the page body, press Ctrl+F6. You hear "Welcome."
    
2. Press the Tab key until you hear "Resources," which is the second link after "Recipients."
    
3. To go to the **Resources** tab on the **Mailboxes** page, press Enter. The focus is on the **Resources** tab. 
    
4. To get to the **New** button on the **Resources** pane, press Ctrl+F6. You hear "New button." 
    
5. To open the **New Item** submenu, press Spacebar. 
    
6. To go to the **Room Mailbox** option, press the Down Arrow key. You hear "Room mailbox." (Narrator says, "Blank line.") 
    
7. To open a **New Room Mailbox** form in a pop-up window, press Enter. You hear the URL of the pop-up window and, eventually, "Room Name." The focus is in the **Room Name** box. This is a required box. 
    
8. Type in the name of the room and, to move into the **Email Address** box, press the Tab key. 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > This name will appear in users' Outlook Address Books. To make rooms easier for users to find, use a consistent naming convention within your organization.

12. Press Enter. This saves the mailbox you created with the values you assigned, and the pop-up window closes, returning you to the **Resources** list on the **Resources** tab. The focus is on the **New Mailbox** button. You hear "New mailbox." 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > It may take a few minutes to save the new mailbox and close the pop-up window. You do not hear any additional feedback during this wait time.
