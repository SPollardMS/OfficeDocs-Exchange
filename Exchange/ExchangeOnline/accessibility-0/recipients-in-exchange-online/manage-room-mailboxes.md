# Create and manage room mailboxes

Estimated time to complete: 5 minutes.
  
A room mailbox is a resource mailbox that's assigned to a physical location, such as a conference room, an auditorium, or a training room. After an administrator creates room mailboxes, users can easily reserve rooms by including room mailboxes in meeting requests. For more details, check out [Recipients](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/40300ed4-85a5-463d-bb3a-cf787bd44e9d.aspx).
  
For info about another type of resource mailbox, check out [Manage equipment mailboxes](manage-equipment-mailboxes.md).
  
## What do you want to do?

- You need to be assigned permissions before you can perform this procedure or procedures. To see what permissions you need, see the "Recipient Provisioning Permissions" section in the [Mailbox Permissions](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/5b690bcb-c6df-4511-90e1-08ca91f43b37.aspx) topic. 
    
> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you're running Exchange 2013 in a hybrid scenario, make sure you create the room mailboxes in the appropriate place. Create your room mailboxes for your on-premises organization on-premises, and room mailboxes for Exchange Online side should be created in the cloud. 
  
### Create a room mailbox

#### Use the Exchange Admin Center to create a room mailbox

1. In the Exchange Admin Center, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Resources**.
    
2. To create a room mailbox, click **New**![Add Icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_AddIcon.gif) \> **Room mailbox**. 
    
3. Use the options on the page to specify the settings for the new resource mailbox.
    
  - **\* Room name** Use this box to type a name for the room mailbox. This is the name that's listed in the resource mailbox list in the Exchange Admin Center and in your organization's address book. This name is required and it can't exceed 64 characters. 
    
    > [!TIP]
    > Although there are other fields that describe the details of the room, for example, Location and Capacity, consider summarizing the most important details in the room name using a consistent naming convention. Why? So users can easily see the details when they select the room from the address book in the meeting request. 
  
  - **\* Email address** A room mailbox has an email address so it can receive booking requests. The email address consists of an alias on the left side of the @ symbol, which must be unique in the forest, and your domain name on the right. The email address is required. 
    
  - **Location**, **Phone**, **Capacity** You can use these fields to enter details about the room. However, as explained earlier, you can include some or all of this information in the room name so users can see it. 
    
4. When you're finished, click **Save** to create the room mailbox. 
    
Once you've created your room mailbox, you can edit your room mailbox to update info about booking options, MailTips and mailbox delegation. Check out the Use the Exchange Admin Center section below to change room mailbox properties
  
#### Use Exchange PowerShell to create a room mailbox

This example creates a room mailbox with the following configuration:
  
- The room mailbox resides on Mailbox Database 1.
    
- The mailbox's name is ConfRoom1. This name will also be used to create the room's email address.
    
- The display name in the Exchange Admin Center and the address book will be Conference Room 1.
    
- The  _Room_ switch specifies that this mailbox will be created as a room mailbox. 
    
```
New-Mailbox -Database "Mailbox Database 1" -Name ConfRoom1 - -DisplayName "Conference Room 1" -Room
```

For detailed syntax and parameter information, see [New-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/42dbb25a-0b23-4775-ae15-7af62c089565.aspx).
  
#### How do you know this worked?

You can make sure you've created the room mailbox correctly a couple of different ways:
  
- In the Exchange Admin Center, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Resources**. The new room mailbox is displayed in the mailbox list. Under **Mailbox Type**, the type is **Room**.
    
- In Exchange PowerShell, run the following command to display information about the new room mailbox.
    
  ```
  Get-Mailbox <Name> | FL Name,RecipientTypeDetails,PrimarySmtpAddress
  ```

### Create a room list

If you're planning to have more than a hundred rooms, or already have more than a hundred rooms created, use a room list to help you organize your rooms. If your company has several buildings with rooms that can be booked for meetings, it might help to create room lists for each building. Room lists are specially marked distribution groups that you can use the same way you use distribution groups. However, you can only create room lists using the Exchange Management Shell.
  
#### Use Exchange PowerShell to create a room list

This example creates a room list for building 32.
  
```
New-DistributionGroup -Name "Building 32 Conference Rooms" -OrganizationalUnit "contoso.com/rooms" -RoomList
```

#### Use Exchange PowerShell to add a room to a room list

This example adds confroom3223 to the building 32 room list.
  
```
Add-DistributionGroupMember -Identity "Building 32 Conference Rooms" -Member confroom3223@contoso.com
```

#### Use Exchange PowerShell to convert a distribution group to a room list

You may already have created distribution groups in the past that contain your conference rooms. You don't need to recreate them; we can convert them quickly into a room list.
  
This example converts the distribution group, building 34 conference rooms, to a room list.
  
```
Set-DistributionGroup -Identity "Building 34 Conference Rooms" -RoomList
```

### Change room mailbox properties

After you create a room mailbox, you can make changes and set additional properties by using the Exchange Admin Center or Exchange PowerShell.
  
#### Use the Exchange Admin Center to change room mailbox properties

1. In the Exchange Admin Center, navigate to **Recipients** \> **Resources**.
    
2. In the list of resource mailboxes, click the room mailbox that you want to change the properties for, and then click **Edit**![Edit icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif).

- **Allow repeating meetings** This setting allows or prevents repeating meetings for the room. By default, this setting is enabled, so repeating meetings are allowed. 
    
- **Allow scheduling only during working hours** This setting accepts or declines meeting requests that aren't during the working hours defined for the room. By default, this setting is disabled, so meeting requests are allowed outside the working hours.By default, working hours are 8:00 A.M. to 5:00 P.M. Monday through Friday. You can configure the working hours of the room mailbox in the Appearance section on the Calendar page. 
    
- **Always decline if the end date is beyond this limit** This setting controls the behavior of repeating meetings that extend beyond the date specified by the maximum booking lead time setting. 
    
  - If you enable this setting, a repeating booking request is automatically declined if the bookings start on or before the date specified by the value in the **Maximum booking lead time** box, and they extend beyond the specified date. This is the default setting. 
    
  - If you disable this setting, a repeating booking request is automatically accepted if booking requests start on or before the date specified by the value in the **Maximum booking lead time** box, and they extend beyond the specified date. However, the number of bookings is reduced so bookings won't occur after the specified date. 
    
- **Maximum booking lead time (days)** This setting specifies the maximum number of days in advance that the room can be booked. Valid input is an integer between 0 and 1080. The default value is 180 days. 
    
- **Maximum duration (hours)** This setting specifies the maximum duration that the room can be reserved in a booking request. The default value is 24 hours. 
    
    For repeating booking requests, the maximum booking duration applies to the length of Exchange Admin Centerh instance of the repeating booking request.

Then click **Browse** and select a dial plan for the mailbox. 
    
  - **Custom address type** Click this button and type one of the supported non-SMTP email address types in the **\* Email address** box. 
    
    > [!NOTE]
    > With the exception of X.400 addresses, Exchange doesn't validate custom addresses for correct formatting. You must make sure that the custom address you specify complies with the format requirements for that address type.

> [!NOTE]
>  MailTips can include HTML tags, but scripts aren't allowed. The length of a custom MailTip can't exceed 175 displayed characters. HTML tags aren't counted in the limit. 
  
#### Use Exchange PowerShell to change room mailbox properties

Use the following sets of cmdlets to view and change room mailbox properties: **Get-Mailbox** and **Set-Mailbox** cmdlets to view and change general properties and email addresses for room mailboxes. Use the **Get-CalendarProcessing** and **Set-CalendarProcessing** cmdlets to view and change delegates and booking options. 
  
- **Get-User** and **Set-User** Use these cmdlets to view and set general properties such as location, department, and company names. 
    
- **Get-Mailbox** and **Set-Mailbox** Use these cmdlets to view and set mailbox properties, such as email addresses and the mailbox database. 
    
- **Get-CalendarProcessing** and **Set-CalendarProcessing** Use these cmdlets to view and set booking options and delegates. 
    
For information about these cmdlets, see the following topics:
  
- [Get-User](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/2a33c9e6-33da-438c-912d-28ce3f4c9afb.aspx)
    
- [Set-User](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/56d7fc86-2ac3-4e28-bc7a-761e91ac655a.aspx)
    
- [Get-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/8a5a6eb9-4a75-47f9-ae3b-a3ba251cf9a8.aspx)
    
- [Set-Mailbox](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/a0d413b9-d949-4df6-ba96-ac0906dedae2.aspx)
    
- [Get-CalendarProcessing](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/8ffece5d-acc9-4061-822e-e452479c03e9.aspx)
    
- [Set-CalendarProcessing](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/000bc90f-1d00-4384-ab59-d6cf6f674825.aspx)
    
Here are some examples of using Exchange PowerShell to change room mailbox properties.
  
This example changes the display name, the primary SMTP address (called the default reply address), and the room capacity. Also, the previous reply address is kept as a proxy address.
  
```
Set-Mailbox "Conf Room 123" -DisplayName "Conf Room 31/123 (12)" -EmailAddresses SMTP:Rm33.123@contoso.com,smtp:rm123@contoso.com -ResourceCapacity 12
```

This example configures room mailboxes to allow booking requests to be scheduled only during working hours and sets a maximum duration of 9 hours.
  
```
Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -Filter {(RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'RoomMailbox')} | Set-CalendarProcessing -ScheduleOnlyDuringWorkHours $true -MaximumDurationInMinutes 540
```

This example uses the **Get-User** cmdlet to find all room mailboxes that correspond to private conference rooms, and then uses the **Set-CalendarProcessing** cmdlet to send booking requests to a delegate named Robin Wood to accept or decline. 
  
```
Get-User -ResultSize unlimited -Filter {(RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'RoomMailbox') -and (DisplayName -like 'Private*')} | Set-CalendarProcessing -AllBookInPolicy $false -AllRequestInPolicy $true -ResourceDelegates "Robin Wood"
```

#### How do you know this worked?

To verify that you've successfully changed properties for a room mailbox, do the following:
  
- In the Exchange Admin Center, select the mailbox and then click **Edit**![Edit icon](../media/ITPro_EAC_EditIcon.gif) to view the property or feature that you changed. Depending on the property that you changed, it might be displayed in the Details pane for the selected mailbox. 
    
- In Exchange PowerShell, use the **Get-Mailbox** cmdlet to verify the changes. One advantage of using Exchange PowerShell is that you can view multiple properties for multiple mailboxes. In the example above where booking requests could be scheduled only during working hours and have a maximum duration of 9 hours, run the following command to verify the new values. 
    
  ```
  Get-Mailbox -ResultSize unlimited -Filter {(RecipientTypeDetails -eq 'RoomMailbox')} | Get-CalendarProcessing | fl Identity,ScheduleOnlyDuringWorkHours,MaximumDurationInMinutes
  ```
