# Message tracking
Learn about message tracking and the message tracking log in Exchange 2016.The message tracking log is a detailed record of all activity as mail flows through the transport pipeline on Mailbox servers and Edge Transport servers. You can use message tracking for message forensics, mail flow analysis, reporting, and troubleshooting.By default, Exchange uses circular logging to limit the message tracking log based on file size and file age to help control the hard disk space that's used by the log files. To configure the message tracking log, see  [Configure message tracking](configure-message-tracking.md). **Contents** [Search the message tracking log](message-tracking.md#Search) [Structure of the message tracking log files](message-tracking.md#Structure) [Fields in the message tracking log files](message-tracking.md#Fields) [Event types in the message tracking log](message-tracking.md#EventTypes) [Source values in the message tracking log](message-tracking.md#Source) [Example entries in the message tracking log](message-tracking.md#Example) [Security concerns for the message tracking log](message-tracking.md#Security)
## Search the message tracking log
<a name="Search"> </a>

Message tracking logs contain vast amounts of data as messages move through a Mailbox server or Edge Transport server. When it comes to searching the message tracking logs, you have different options.
  
    
    

- **Get-MessageTrackingLog** Administrators can use this Exchange Management Shell cmdlet to search the message tracking log for information about messages using a wide range of filter criteria. For more information, see [Search message tracking logs](search-message-tracking-logs.md).
    
  
- **Delivery reports for administrators** Administrators can use the **Delivery reports** tab in the Exchange admin center or the underlying **Search-MessageTrackingReport** and **Get-MessageTrackingReport** cmdlets in the Exchange Management Shell to search the message tracking logs for information about messages sent by or received by a specific mailbox in the organization. For more information, see [Delivery reports for administrators](delivery-reports-for-administrators.md).
    
  
- **Delivery reports for users** Users can use the **Delivery reports** tab in Outlook on the web to search the message tracking logs for information about messages sent to or sent by their own mailbox. For more information, see [Delivery Reports for Users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=279920).

## Structure of the message tracking log files
<a name="Structure"> </a>

By default, the message tracking log files exist in  `%ExchangeInstallPath%TransportRoles\\Logs\\MessageTracking`. The folder contains log files that have different names, but they all follow the naming convention  `MSGTRKServiceyyyymmdd-nnnn.log`. The different log file names are described in the following table.
  
    
    

****


|**File name**|**Servers**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| `MSGTRK` <br/> |Mailbox servers and Edge Transport servers  <br/> |Log files for the Transport service.  <br/> |
| `MSGTRKMA` <br/> |Mailbox servers  <br/> |Log files for the approvals and rejections in moderated transport. For more information, see  [Moderated Transport](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/43a89f71-8002-4cb0-b3c8-1c2b2597f227.aspx).  <br/> |
| `MSGTRKMD` <br/> |Mailbox servers  <br/> |Log files for messages delivered to mailboxes by the Mailbox Transport Delivery service.  <br/> |
| `MSGTRKMS` <br/> |Mailbox servers  <br/> |Log files for messages sent from mailboxes by the Mailbox Transport Submission service.  <br/> |
   
The other placeholders in the log file names represent the following information:
  
    
    

-  _yyyymmdd_ is the coordinated universal time (UTC) date when the log file was created. _yyyy_ = year, _mm_ = month, and _dd_ = day.
    
  
-  _nnnn_ is an instance number that starts at the value 1 every day for each log.
    
  
Information is written to the log file until the file reaches its maximum size. Then, a new log file that has an incremented instance number is opened (the first log file is -1, the next is -2, and so on). Circular logging deletes the oldest log files for a service when either of the following conditions are true:
  
    
    

- A log file reaches its maximum age.
    
  
- The message tracking log folder reaches its maximum size.
    
    > [!IMPORTANT]
      > The maximum size of the message tracking log folder is calculated as the total size of all log files that have the same name prefix. Other files that do not follow the name prefix convention are not counted in the total folder size calculation. Renaming old log files or copying other files into the message tracking log folder could cause the folder to exceed its specified maximum size. > On Mailbox servers, the maximum size of the message tracking log folder is three times the specified value. Although the message tracking log files are generated by the four different services and have four different name prefixes, the amount and frequency of data written to the moderated transport log ( `MSGTRKMA`) is negligible compared to the other three logs. 
The message tracking log files are text files that contain data in the comma-separated value (CSV) format. Each message tracking log file has a header that contains the following information:
  
    
    

- **#Software:** The value is `Microsoft Exchange Server`.
    
  
- **#Version:** Version number of the Exchange server that created the message tracking log file. The value uses the format `15.01.nnnn.nnn`.
    
  
- **#Log-Type:** The value is `Message Tracking Log`.
    
  
- **#Date:** The UTC date-time when the log file was created. The UTC date-time is represented in the ISO 8601 date-time format: _yyyy-mm-dd_T _hh:mm:ss.fff_Z, where  _yyyy_ = year, _mm_ = month, _dd_ = day, T indicates the beginning of the time component, _hh_ = hour, _mm_ = minute, _ss_ = second, _fff_ = fractions of a second, and Z signifies Zulu, which is another way to denote UTC.
    
  
- **#Fields:** Comma-delimited field names that are used in the message tracking log files.

## Fields in the message tracking log files
<a name="Fields"> </a>

The message tracking log stores each message event on a single line in the log. The message event information is organized by fields, and these fields are separated by commas. The field name is generally descriptive enough to determine the type of information that it contains. However, some fields may be blank, or the type of information in the field may change based on the message event type and the service that recorded the event. General descriptions of the fields that are used to classify each message tracking event are explained in the following table.
  
    
    


|**Field name**|**Description**|
|:-----|:-----|
|**date-time** <br/> |The UTC date-time of the message tracking event. The UTC date-time is represented in the ISO 8601 date-time format:  _yyyy-mm-dd_T _hh:mm:ss.fff_Z, where  _yyyy_ = year, _mm_ = month, _dd_ = day, T indicates the beginning of the time component, _hh_ = hour, _mm_ = minute, _ss_ = second, _fff_ = fractions of a second, and Z signifies Zulu, which is another way to denote UTC. <br/> |
|**client-ip** <br/> |The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the messaging server or messaging client that submitted the message.  <br/> |
|**client-hostname** <br/> |The host name or FQDN of the messaging server or messaging client that submitted the message.  <br/> |
|**server-ip** <br/> |The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the source or destination server.  <br/> |
|**server-hostname** <br/> |The host name or FQDN of the destination server.  <br/> |
|**source-context** <br/> | Extra information associated with the **source** field. For example: <br/>  `CatContentConversion` <br/>  `250 2.0.0 OK;ClientSubmitTime:<UTC>` <br/> |
|**connector-id** <br/> |The name of the Send connector or Receive connector that accepted the message. For example,  _ServerName_\\ _ConnectorName_ or _ConnectorName_.  <br/> |
|**source** <br/> |The Exchange transport component that's responsible for the event. These values are described in the  [Source values in the message tracking log](message-tracking.md#Source) section later in this topic. <br/> |
|**event-id** <br/> |The message event type. These values are described in the  [Event types in the message tracking log](message-tracking.md#EventTypes) section later in this topic. <br/> |
|**internal-message-id** <br/> |A message identifier that's assigned by the Exchange server that's currently processing the message.  <br/> The **internal-message-id** of a message is different in the message tracking log of every Exchange server that's involved in the transmission of the message. An example value is `73014444033`.  <br/> |
|**message-id** <br/> |The value of the **Message-Id:** header field in the message header. If the **Message-Id:** header field doesn't exist or is blank, Exchange assigns an arbitrary value. This value is constant for the lifetime of the message. For messages created in Exchange, the value is in the format `<GUID@ServerFQDN>`, including the angle brackets ( `< >`). For example,  `<4867a3d78a50438bad95c0f6d072fca5@mailbox01.contoso.com>`. Other messaging systems may use different syntax or values.  <br/> |
|**network-message-id** <br/> |A unique message ID value that persists across copies of the message that may be created due to bifurcation or distribution group expansion. An example value is  `1341ac7b13fb42ab4d4408cf7f55890f`.  <br/> |
|**recipient-address** <br/> |The email addresses of the message's recipients. Multiple email addresses are separated by the semicolon character (;).  <br/> |
|**recipient-status** <br/> | The recipient status for each recipient separated by the semicolon character (;). The status values are presented for the recipients in the same order as the values in the **recipient-address** field. Example status values include: <br/>  `To`,  `Cc` or `Bcc` <br/>  `250 2.1.5 Recipient OK` <br/>  `550 4.4.7 QUEUE.Expired;<ErrorText>` <br/> |
|**total-bytes** <br/> |The total size of the message in bytes, including all attachments.  <br/> |
|**recipient-count** <br/> |The total number of recipients in the message.  <br/> |
|**related-recipient-address** <br/> |This field is used with **EXPAND**, **REDIRECT**, and **RESOLVE** events to display other recipient email addresses that are associated with the message. <br/> |
|**reference** <br/> | This field contains additional information for specific types of events. For example: <br/> **DSN** Contains the report link, which is the **Message-Id** value of the associated delivery status notification (also known as a DSN, bounce message, non-delivery report, or NDR) if a DSN is generated subsequent to this event. If this is a DSN message, the **Reference** field contains the **Message-Id** value of the original message that the DSN was generated for. <br/> **EXPAND** Contains the **related-recipient-address** value of the related messages. <br/> **RECEIVE** May contain the **Message-Id** value of the related message if the message was generated by other processes, for example, journaling or inbox rules. <br/> **SEND** Contains the **Internal-Message-Id** value of any DSN messages. <br/> **THROTTLE** Contains the reason why the message was throttled. <br/> **TRANSFER** Contains the **Internal-Message-Id** value of the message that's being forked. <br/> **Message generated by inbox rules** Contains the **Internal-Message-Id** value of the inbound message that caused the inbox rule to generate the outbound message. <br/>  May contain the **Internal-Message-Id** value for forked messages. <br/>  For other types of events, this field is usually blank. <br/> |
|**message-subject** <br/> | The message's subject found in the **Subject:** header field. The tracking of message subjects is controlled by the _MessageTrackingLogSubjectLoggingEnabled_ parameter on the **Set-TransportService** cmdlet. By default, message subject tracking is enabled. <br/> |
|**sender-address** <br/> |The email address specified in the **Sender:** header field, or the **From:** header field if the **Sender:** field doesn't exist. <br/> |
|**return-path** <br/> |The return email address specified by the **MAIL FROM** command that sent the message. Although this field is never empty, it can have the null sender address value represented as `<>`.  <br/> |
|**message-info** <br/> | Additional information about the message. For example: <br/>  The message origination date-time in UTC for **DELIVER** and **SEND** events. The origination date-time is the time when the message first entered the Exchange organization. The UTC date-time is represented in the ISO 8601 date-time format: _yyyy-mm-dd_T _hh:mm:ss.fff_Z, where  _yyyy_ = year, _mm_ = month, _dd_ = day, T indicates the beginning of the time component, _hh_ = hour, _mm_ = minute, _ss_ = second, _fff_ = fractions of a second, and Z signifies Zulu, which is another way to denote UTC. <br/>  Authentication errors. For example, you may see the value `11a` and the type of authentication that was used when the authentication error occurred. <br/> |
|**directionality** <br/> |The direction of the message. Example values include  `Incoming`,  `Undefined`, and  `Originating`.  <br/> |
|**tenant-id** <br/> |This field isn't used in on-premises Exchange organizations.  <br/> |
|**original-client-ip** <br/> |The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the original client.  <br/> |
|**original-server-ip** <br/> |The IPv4 or IPv6 address of the original server.  <br/> |
|**custom-data** <br/> |This field contains data related to specific event types. For example, the Transport Rule agent uses this field to record the GUID of the transport rule or DLP policy that acted on the message. For more information about these Transport Rule agent values, see the "Data logging" section in the  [DLP Policy Detection Management](http://technet.microsoft.com/library/5c3f1cf6-d8c7-4d83-bb24-641ea9d50cbc.aspx) topic, <br/> |
|**transport-traffic-type** <br/> |In on-premises Exchange, this field is blank or has the value  `Email`.  <br/> |
|**log-id** <br/> |A unique identifier for a row in the in the message tracking log. This field isn't important in on-premises Exchange organizations.  <br/> |
|**schema-version** <br/> |Version number of the Exchange server that created the entry in the message tracking log. The value uses the format  `15.01.nnnn.nnn`.  <br/> |

## Example entries in the message tracking log
<a name="Example"> </a>

An uneventful message sent between two users generates several entries in the message tracking log. You can see the results using the **Get-MessageTrackingLog** cmdlet. For more information, see [Search message tracking logs](search-message-tracking-logs.md).
  
    
    
This is an example of the message tracking log entries created when the user chris@contoso.com successfully sends a test message to the user michelle@contoso.com. Both users have mailboxes on the same server.

## Security concerns for the message tracking log
<a name="Security"> </a>

No message content is stored in the message tracking log. By default, the subject line of an email message is stored in the message tracking log. You might need to disable subject logging to comply with increased security or privacy requirements. For instructions on how to disable subject logging, see  [Configure message tracking](configure-message-tracking.md).
